# Stable-Diffusion-portable

INTRODUCTION
🔥🔥Stable-Diffusion-Portable🔥🔥
Made By: Sameer Sahu
This project was a desperate attempt to run stable diffusion in collab, there might be some bugs here and there, but i have tried my best to make this as good as possible.

Description: This ipynb basically deploys/manages copies of premade stable-diffusion installation images on Google-collab. I have provided a pretty small and lightweight image with this project which loads quick enough(~10min for startup). custom images can be saved easily by backing up your entire installations as a zip file. By default in the basic-img your outputs will be stored in your google drive instead of your regular output folder

For-Newbies: Don't run all the cells blindly, go through them and only run what you need
