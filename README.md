<justify>This project was a desperate attempt to run stable diffusion in collab, there might be some bugs here and there, but i have tried my best to make this as good as possible.

Description: This ipynb basically deploys/manages copies of premade stable-diffusion installation images on Google-collab. I have provided a pretty small and lightweight image with this project which loads quick enough(~10min for startup). custom images can be saved easily by backing up your entire installations as a zip file. By default in the basic-img your outputs will be stored in your google drive instead of your regular output folder<br>The application is quite fast and runs with very low maintanence. <br><br> Ps: lend me a hand by giving this repo a star.<justify>
